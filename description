The road to monad transfomers

In this talk, we'll climb the misty hills of Monad Transfomers.
Setting out from our 'Base Monad', we'll make sure to stay energized by feeding on 'Aha!' moments as we gain more elevation.
While there may be no shortcuts worth taking, the view from top will offer us a new perspective on many other familiar topics.

Whether you know nothing about monads or everything about the transformers, you're welcome to join!
This talk focuses less on 'what is it?' but more on 'how do we get to undertand it?'.
